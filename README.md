## Number Magic

The world's first automated math program. 

When the computer was invented in 1999, those eggheads forgot to put numbers in there. For years the world has been limited to 10 fingers (and 10 toes for more complex calculations)

But after 20 years of research, you can finally do numbers. Or rather, you can do numbers on the same machine that you browse twitter on! (NOTE: Due to processing limitations, it is highly recommended that you close all other applications before doing numbers).

Imagine this scenario: Bobby has two apples. He recieves 3 apples from his friend Sally and then eats 1 apple. Suddenly a man with a knife approaches Bobby and demands to know how many apples he has. Bobby panics, he doesn't know how to do numbers. You'd need some kind of machine to do that. Bobby is murdered on the spot, leaving him apple-less.

Now this was just a hypothetical situation, but it serves to highlight the importance of knowing exactly how many apples you have at all times. How is this possible? NUMBER MAGIC. As long as you have access to a computer, you can use NUMBER MAGIC to prevent any apple-related acts of violence. (If you do not have access to a computer, NUMBER MAGIC CO. highly recommends avoiding apples at all costs.)

Now get out there and do some numbers before we all die from the inevitable environmental disasters that await us.

### Usage

Upon start the interactive prompt will expect one of the following commands:

    add <int 1> <int 2> ... <int n>

    subtract <int 1> <int 2> ... <int n>

    multiply <int 1> <int 2> ... <int n>

    divide <int 1> <int 2> ... <int n>  -- WARNING: None of the integers past int 1 can be zero. Don't fucking try it you piece of shit.

    random <lower bound> <upper bound> -- Note: If upper bound is excluded, number generated will be 0 .. lower bound.

    factorial <int> -- Note: Only accepts positive numbers, negative numbers really kill the vibe.

You can also use shorthands for these commands if you hate typing like me: sub, mul, div, rand, fact.

If you're a real moron and mess something up, it's OK. Thankfully the computer should be smart enough to catch your mistakes.

If you crash this program I will sue you.

### About

A naive first project using Rust. Mostly trying to understand some of the fundamental concepts. Please don't take this seriously.
